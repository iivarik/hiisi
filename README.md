# Hiisi

Hiisi is a portfolio optimization tool built with Rust that uses advanced mathematical models and data analysis techniques to help investors optimize their portfolios for maximum returns. The tool allows users to input a range of assets and their corresponding historical performance data, and uses optimization algorithms to determine the optimal allocation of assets for a given risk tolerance and investment horizon.

## What is portfolio optimization?

Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the optimal mix of assets to include in an investment portfolio, with the goal of maximizing returns while minimizing risk. This involves analyzing historical performance data for a range of assets, identifying correlations and patterns, and using advanced mathematical models to determine the optimal allocation of assets.

## What does "Hiisi" mean?

"Hiisi" is a term used in Finnish mythology to describe spirits or creatures that dwell in the forest. This name was chosen for the project as it reflects the tool's focus on using advanced computational methods to uncover hidden patterns and insights in financial data, much like the mythical creatures of Finnish folklore who are said to possess special knowledge of the natural world.

## Features

- Input a range of assets and their corresponding historical performance data
- Choose a risk tolerance and investment horizon to optimize for
- Use advanced optimization algorithms to determine the optimal allocation of assets
- View detailed performance metrics and charts for each asset in the portfolio
- Export portfolio data to CSV or other formats for further analysis

## Getting started

To get started with Hiisi, clone the repository and run the following command: `cargo run`

This will compile and execute the Hiisi tool, allowing you to input assets and historical performance data and optimize your portfolio for maximum returns.
